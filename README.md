# Lankwitz

Lankwitz is a personal thinking operating system.

It captures life as it happens,  
stores it without distortion,  
and preserves only what survives judgment.

> 저장은 정직하게,  
> 판단은 느리게,  
> 사유는 소수만.**

## What Lankwitz Is

Lankwitz is not a note-taking app.
It is a system for deciding **what deserves to remain**.

It separates:
- recording from thinking
- storage from judgment
- memory from meaning

## Core Concepts

- **Log**: raw records of life (Blackbox)
- **Review**: judgment layer
- **Zettels**: surviving thoughts (Mindgraph)

Paper, Obsidian, and CLI are tools — not the system itself.

## System Flow

Paper → Log → Review → Zettels

- Capture fast
- Store honestly
- Judge slowly
- Think selectively

## Philosophy (one sentence)

> Lankwitz exists to prevent unexamined accumulation.
