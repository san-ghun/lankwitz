# Lankwitz - System Overview

Lankwitz is a modular system composed of five independent roles:

1. Paper — Capture
2. Log — Storage
3. Review — Judgment
4. Zettels — Thinking
5. lkw — Control Plane

Each role has a single responsibility.
No role overlaps with another.

The system collapses if judgment leaks into capture or storage.

# Workflow

## Daily

- Capture freely on paper
- Transfer to Log (Obsidian)
- Mark ★ only

## Weekly

- Run Review
- Select 0–3 candidates
- Create Zettels if necessary

No Zettel creation without Review.

---
# Paper — Capture Module

Purpose:
- Do not miss life as it happens

Rules:
- No structure
- No judgment
- No cleanup

Paper is disposable.
Its job ends when data enters Log.

---
# Log — Blackbox Module

Purpose:
- Preserve raw experience

Rules:
- Date-based
- Editable for factual accuracy
- Never summarized

Log is memory, not meaning.

---
# Review — Judgment Module

Purpose:
- Decide what survives

Fixed Questions:
1. Does it repeat?
2. Does it remain uncomfortable?
3. Does it generate questions?

Review is selection, not production.

---
# Zettels — Mindgraph Module

Purpose:
- Preserve validated thoughts

Rules:
- One claim per note
- Explicit grounding in Log
- Actively edited or deleted

Zettels are outcomes, not drafts.

---
# lkw — Control Plane

Purpose:
- Enforce thinking flow

lkw never:
- interprets
- summarizes
- decides

lkw exists to introduce friction.
